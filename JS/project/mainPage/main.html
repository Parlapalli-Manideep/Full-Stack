          <div class="accordion-body">The difference between a digital currency and a cryptocurrency is that the latter
            is decentralised, meaning it is not issued or backed by a central authority such as a central bank or
            government. Instead, cryptocurrencies run across a network of computers. Digital currencies have all the
            characteristics of traditional currencies but exist only in the digital world. They are issued by a central
            authority.</div>

          <div class="accordion-body">There are five main types of cryptocurrency wallets, namely desktop wallets,
            mobile wallets, online wallets, hardware wallets and paper wallets. You do not need a wallet if you are
            trading cryptocurrencies via a CFD account, only when you are buying them. Wallets are used to store, send
            and receive cryptocurrencies.</div>

            but the first transaction took place in 2009. It was developed by someone called ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’.
            However, there is speculation that Nakamoto is a pseudonym as the bitcoin creator is notoriously secretive,
            and no one knows whether ‘he’ is a person or a group.</div>

          <div class="accordion-body">Cryptocurrencies are an alternative to traditional money. Today, some outlets
            accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. However, they bear little resemblance to other asset classes

            and falls in value.</div>
